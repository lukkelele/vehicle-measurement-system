### Dependencies
- freeRTOS
- Micropython
- PiCamera


### System components
 - Raspberry Pi 1 Model B
 - Raspberry Pi Pico W
 - PiCamera v2 module
 - Wiring

## VMS
The system is called VMS for short and the abbreviation is used in the code structure to give a clear indicitation to what's what.

### VMSClient
The client side which is located on the **Pico W**.

### VMSCamera
Camera component of the system which resides on the **Raspberry Pi**.

### VMSServer
Server to recieve the transmitted data from **VMSClient**.



<p style="font-size: 28px;"><strong>How it works</strong>:</p>
<div align="center">
<p style="font-weight: 600"> VMSCamera ðŸ ²  VMSClient â‡† VMSServer </p> 
VMSCamera takes the pictures and sends them via the UART to the Pico W which is the client (VMSClient). <br>
The Pico W then sends the frames to the server via a p2p connection which in turn takes appropriate action (e.g saving the frames, recognizing errors etc).<br>
The saved frames/images are then sent to another program which processes the images and determines the length of the vehicles.
